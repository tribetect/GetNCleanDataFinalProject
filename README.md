## What it does:
[run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) tidies the human activity data '[UCI Human Activity Recognition by Smartphone] 
(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)'

## How do I use it?
1. Download the data files from the [UCI lab server] or [Coursera Get-and-Clean Data] 
2. Unzip the files in your working directory. A typically unzips to a folder *UCI HAR Dataset*
3. Download [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) to the working directory.
4. Ensure both [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) and the source data folder *UCI HAR Dataset* are at the same level.
5. Source the R script in R or RStudio to autorun and tidy the data set.  

## Requirements
The script has been tested in RStudio with *R version 3.2.0 'Full of Ingredients'*

## Output
The tidy data set looks like this: [UCI_Smartphone_data_tidy.txt](UCI_Smartphone_data_tidy.txt)
